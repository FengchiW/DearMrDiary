Hey It looks like you found the hidden room

Well this isn't part of the game at all but it is a easteregg

As you probably should have found the hidden message was "happy" But know the world now you probably navigated to this page by someone else sharing the url
Witch is fine its just not as fun right (tear) Anyways it doent matter
See in this room I want to tell you about the backstory behind Paige

She was made up yes but her story isn't.
I've hear her story countless times on the news for different peopleand well made paige as the embodyment of these people
See in this story the first diary page is on year 34, and the last true documented day is on day 44.
why 34, 44?
well that because 34-44 year olds have the higest suacide rates as of (2005)

Also notice how none of the entry specify a month and many days are oddly skiped?
