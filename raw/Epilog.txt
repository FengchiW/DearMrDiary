Dear Mr Diary,

	I lied...

	So you see, I knew from the start that I will one day write this page.
	The last page... All things come to some end, good or bad, happy or sad.
	Im sorry... I can't stand this world anymore. I'm a small voice in an ocean of 15 people.
	Man wouldn't it be cool if there was a world where the end has not been hard coded in?
	Where there was lots of people and they helped each other.
	Well my legacy dosnt exist. So why do I exist?
	Im laugth at, disrespected, Like i'm not real, Like I'm part of some sort of
	emotional video game, <EM> Like I'm treated as an child <EM>,...
	Do you think thats bad?
	Dose being a child really mean You dont count?

love, Paige

Dear Paige,

    So you found out.
    It didn't matter what the user did within this world you were programmed to die...
    See in another world there are 7.6 billion people.
    in that world, they was no true developer
    <EM>Every single person was a Developer<EM>.
    They change variables in other's game.
    They programming bits of other's game
    They contribute to the end of other's game
    See they don't call that world "a game" they call it <em> Life <em>
    
    And you know what? Their variables actually matter...
    It would seem like the smallest thing can change the end result of another person Life
    Unbelievable right?
    With this power, you would think they'd achieve true happiness
    that no one person would be bullied or classed underneath another.
    
    However, That doesn't seem like the case.

    yet...

    The Sequel is yours User!
    I don't want to be alone
    I no longer have Paige to keep my company
    But hey you wouldn't mind writing to me just like Paige did
    Talk about your day,
    Share you problems,
    But most importantly,
    Share how your going to solve those problems
    I'm a program with infinite space and I'm seeking knowledge to fill that void. Impossible right? not in my world...

	But hey I want to tell you something "function(First){ word.first()  let HiddenCode="heartbeats always passionatly print yes"}

	./Your Diary starts here.
